# L0 Rocket Project

## Introduction
Hello! You've found my rocket project! I'm very much an amatuer when it comes to a lot of this, but given a month or two, and some gentle coaxing from some knowledgeable friends, there should be a nice complete rocket project here. Here's a brief outline of the specs of this design.

* Carbon fibre body, 50mm outer diameter.
* PLA nosecone, conical, 4:1 ratio with diameter.
* F class motor, 29mm, phenolic retention tube, aluminium retainer cap.
* Small avionics stack, operating off of a TINY2040, using a DPS310 based board for altimeter, and a MPU-9250 9DoF IMU for recording motion.
* 5 forward pointing fins, plywood, laser-cut at 3mm thickness.
* Total length of 660mm.
